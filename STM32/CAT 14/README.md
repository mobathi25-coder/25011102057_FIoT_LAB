## Core Logic / Pseudocode / Code Base

### Core Logic

The application collects environmental measurements from the BME280 sensor using the I²C communication protocol. The Bosch BME280 API is used to initialize the sensor, configure its operating settings, and obtain compensated temperature, pressure, and humidity values.

The STM32 then constructs a JSON payload containing the sensor readings and publishes it to an MQTT broker through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module using the custom ESP8266 MQTT library.

The same readings are also transmitted through USART2 for serial monitoring and debugging.

Node-RED receives the published JSON messages through an MQTT In node and processes the sensor values for visualization. MQTTX is used as an MQTT client to monitor and verify the published messages.

### Pseudocode

```text
START

1. SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
   Initialize STM32 HAL.
   Configure the system clock.
   Initialize GPIO.
   Initialize I2C1.
   Initialize USART1.
   Initialize USART2.

2. BME280 SENSOR INITIALIZATION
   Set BME280 device address to primary I2C address (0x76).

   Configure BME280 device structure:
       Set communication interface to I2C.
       Assign I2C read callback function.
       Assign I2C write callback function.
       Assign delay callback function.

   Initialize BME280 using Bosch Sensor API.

   IF initialization fails THEN
       Print initialization error through USART2.
       Enter error handler.
   ELSE
       Print initialization success message.
   END IF

3. BME280 CONFIGURATION
   Set temperature oversampling to 1x.
   Set pressure oversampling to 1x.
   Set humidity oversampling to 1x.
   Disable sensor filter.

   Apply sensor settings.

   IF configuration fails THEN
       Print configuration error.
       Enter error handler.
   END IF

   Set BME280 to NORMAL mode.

   IF mode configuration fails THEN
       Print error message.
       Enter error handler.
   END IF

4. ESP8266 INITIALIZATION
   Initialize ESP8266 in Station Mode using USART1.

   IF initialization fails THEN
       Print error message through USART2.
       Enter error handler.
   END IF

   Connect ESP8266 to Wi-Fi network.
   Configure single TCP connection mode.

5. MQTT BROKER CONNECTION
   Establish TCP connection with MQTT broker:
       Broker address = broker.emqx.io
       Port = 1883

   Initialize MQTT client parameters:
       Keep-alive = 500
       Clean session = Enabled
       Client ID = AN_Publisher

   Connect MQTT client to broker.

6. CONTINUOUS SENSOR DATA ACQUISITION AND PUBLISHING

   WHILE TRUE DO

       Read temperature, pressure and humidity
       from BME280 using Bosch Sensor API.

       IF sensor reading is successful THEN

           Store compensated temperature in Celsius.
           Convert pressure from Pa to hPa.
           Store compensated humidity in %RH.

           Construct JSON payload containing:
               Status = "success"
               Temperature
               Humidity
               Pressure

           Publish JSON payload to MQTT topic:
               Topic = "iot/bme"
               QoS = 0

           Transmit sensor readings through USART2
           for serial monitoring.

       ELSE

           Print sensor reading failure message
           through USART2.

       END IF

       Wait for 1000 milliseconds.

   END WHILE

END
```

### JSON Payload Format

The STM32 constructs a JSON message in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "temperature": 28.45,
  "humidity": 62.30,
  "pressure": 1008.72
}
```

The values shown are illustrative. Actual values depend on the BME280 sensor readings.

## INFERENCE

The BME280 environmental sensor was successfully interfaced with the STM32 NUCLEO-F410RB development board using the I²C communication protocol and the Bosch BME280 Sensor API.

The STM32 acquired compensated temperature, pressure, and humidity measurements, converted the pressure readings from Pa to hPa, and formatted the sensor values into a JSON payload.

Using the custom ESP8266 MQTT library, the STM32 connected to a Wi-Fi network and an MQTT broker. The JSON-formatted sensor readings were published periodically to the MQTT topic `iot/bme` using QoS 0.

The published environmental data was received in Node-RED for monitoring and visualization. MQTTX was also used to monitor the MQTT messages, demonstrating an IoT-based environmental sensing and MQTT communication system.
