## 3. NAME OF EXP
UART Driver and Serial Debugging

## 4. HARDWARE SETUP / PLATFORM

- **Development Board:** 8051 Development Board
- **Microcontroller:** AT89S52
- **Crystal Frequency:** 11.0592 MHz
- **Serial Communication Interface:** USB-to-TTL Converter
- **PC Terminal Software:** PuTTY
- **UART Configuration:** 9600-8-N-1
  - Baud Rate: 9600 bps
  - Data Bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop Bits: 1
- **Baud Rate Generator:** Timer 1, Mode 2 (8-bit auto-reload)
- **UART Operating Mode:** Mode 1 (8-bit asynchronous serial communication)

The AT89S52 uses its alternate-function serial communication pins:

- **P3.1 (TXD):** Serial data transmission
- **P3.0 (RXD):** Serial data reception

## 5. TASK NO

### Task 1 – UART Initialization and Character Transmission

Configure the AT89S52 UART for 9600-8-N-1 communication and continuously transmit the message `Hello from 8051` to a PC terminal using PuTTY.

### Task 2 – UART Echo

Receive characters transmitted from the PC terminal through UART and transmit the same characters back to the PC.

For example, when the user types `ABC123` in PuTTY, the 8051 receives the characters and sends them back to the terminal.

**Hardware Connections:**

| AT89S52 / Board Pin | USB-to-TTL Converter |
|---|---|
| P3.1 (TXD) | RXD |
| P3.0 (RXD) | TXD |
| GND | GND |

The USB-to-TTL converter is connected to the PC through USB and communicates with PuTTY through the corresponding serial COM port.

The board uses an external 11.0592 MHz crystal connected to the AT89S52 oscillator pins (XTAL1 and XTAL2).

## 7. CORE LOGIC / PSEUDOCODE / CODE BASE

### Task 1 – UART Initialization and Character Transmission

**Core Logic:**

1. Configure the UART in Mode 1 for 8-bit asynchronous serial communication.
2. Configure Timer 1 in Mode 2 to generate the required baud rate.
3. Load TH1 with `0xFD` for 9600 baud using an 11.0592 MHz crystal.
4. Start Timer 1.
5. Store the message `Hello from 8051` in a character array.
6. Transmit each character through SBUF.
7. Wait until the TI flag becomes 1, indicating completion of transmission.
8. Clear TI and continue transmitting the remaining characters.
9. Repeat the message continuously.

**Pseudocode:**

```text
START

1. Initialize UART:
   - Configure UART Mode 1.
   - Configure Timer 1 in Mode 2.
   - Load TH1 with 0xFD.
   - Start Timer 1.

2. Store "Hello from 8051" in a character array.

3. REPEAT FOREVER:
   FOR each character in the message:
      a. Load character into SBUF.
      b. Wait until TI = 1.
      c. Clear TI.

END
```

**Code Base:** `Task1/TASK1.c`

### Task 2 – UART Echo

**Core Logic:**

1. Initialize the UART in Mode 1 and enable reception using REN.
2. Configure Timer 1 in Mode 2 for 9600 baud communication.
3. Continuously monitor the RI flag.
4. When RI becomes 1, read the received character from SBUF.
5. Clear RI after reading the character.
6. Load the received character into SBUF for transmission.
7. Wait until TI becomes 1, indicating that transmission is complete.
8. Clear TI and repeat the process for the next character.

**Pseudocode:**

```text
START

1. Initialize UART:
   - Set SCON = 0x50.
   - Configure Timer 1 in Mode 2.
   - Load TH1 and TL1 with 0xFD.
   - Start Timer 1.
   - Clear RI and TI.

2. REPEAT FOREVER:
   a. Wait until RI = 1.
   b. Read the received character from SBUF.
   c. Clear RI.
   d. Load the received character into SBUF.
   e. Wait until TI = 1.
   f. Clear TI.

END
```

**Code Base:** `Task2/TASK2.c`

### Communication Verification

The following communication settings are used in PuTTY:

- Baud Rate: 9600
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Parity: None
- Flow Control: None

**Task 1 Expected Output:**

```text
Hello from 8051
Hello from 8051
Hello from 8051
...
```

**Task 2 Expected Output:**

Input typed in PuTTY:

```text
ABC123
```

Characters transmitted back by the 8051:

```text
ABC123
```

## 8. INFERENCE

The experiment demonstrates serial communication between the AT89S52 microcontroller and a PC terminal using UART.

UART Mode 1 was configured for 8-bit asynchronous communication, while Timer 1 in Mode 2 generated the baud rate of 9600 using the 11.0592 MHz crystal.

In Task 1, the microcontroller continuously transmitted a predefined message to the PC terminal. In Task 2, the microcontroller received characters from the PC and transmitted the same characters back, demonstrating UART echo functionality.

The TI and RI flags were used to monitor the completion of character transmission and reception, respectively.

**Implementation Note:** The programs implemented in these tasks use polling to monitor the TI and RI flags. They demonstrate basic UART transmission and reception but do not implement UART interrupt service routines or the RX ring buffer mentioned in the overall problem statement.
