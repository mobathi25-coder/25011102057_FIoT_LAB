## 5. TASK NO

This experiment consists of three tasks:

### Task 1 – Task 7A: LCD Initialization and Character/String Display

Develop a 4-bit GPIO-based LCD driver and configure the 16×2 LCD for 4-bit, 2-line operation. Display character and string data.

[View Task 1 README](TASK1/README.md)

### Task 2 – Task 7B: Cursor Positioning and Dynamic Value Update

Develop cursor-positioning and data-update functions, including `lcd_goto()`, `lcd_puts()` and `lcd_print_number()`.

[View Task 2 README](TASK2/README.md)

### Task 3 – Task 7C: 4×4 Keypad-Based Character Movement

Develop an interactive application in which a character is moved across the 16×2 LCD using keypad directional inputs.

**Common LCD Connections:**

| AT89S52 Pin | LCD Pin |
|---|---|
| P3.4 | D4 |
| P3.5 | D5 |
| P3.6 | D6 |
| P3.7 | D7 |
| P3.3 | E |
| P3.2 | RS |

The LCD also requires power, ground, contrast and RW connections. These must be represented according to the actual development board and laboratory wiring.

Task 3 additionally uses the keypad connections specified in its individual task documentation.

## 7. CORE LOGIC / PSEUDOCODE / CODE BASE

- Transmit character data using the LCD data pins.

**Important Concepts:**
- LCD command and data transmission.
- RS and Enable control signals.
- 4-bit communication.
- Software timing delays.

**Code Base:** `Task1/TASK1.c`

### Task 2 – Cursor Positioning and Dynamic Value Update

**Core Logic:**

- Identify the selected direction.
- Erase the character from its current position.
- Update the row or column.
- Display the character at its new position.
- Prevent movement outside the LCD boundaries.

**Important Concepts:**
- Matrix keypad interfacing.

## 8. INFERENCE

The experiment demonstrates the interfacing and control of a 16×2 HD44780-compatible character LCD using the AT89S52 microcontroller.

It covers LCD initialization, 4-bit data communication, command and character transmission, DDRAM-based cursor positioning, string and integer display, and dynamic display updates.

The keypad-based movement task further demonstrates how GPIO inputs can be used to control the position of a character on an LCD.

Overall, the experiment provides practical experience in reading peripheral datasheets, deriving command sequences, developing low-level Embedded C drivers and interfacing external peripherals with an 8051 microcontroller.

**Implementation Note:** The supplied programs contain some initialization and keypad pin-mapping issues that should be verified against the actual hardware and LCD datasheet. The individual task READMEs document these observations. The code should not be considered a complete implementation of every required function until those issues are checked.
